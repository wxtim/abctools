Curlew gliden o'r the heather
Softly melting caverns bright
tearing at the very heartstings
pouring beauty from the sky

High above the green backed plovers
fluting wind is magic spell
all the stillness of the water
of the quiet Lady's well

all the lilting liquid rythym
stored within a shepherds harp
skillfully he shaped and polish
strung them with a craftsmens eye

now today with cudding finger
can the piper play t' tune
haunting deep and timeless beauty
where in Coquetdale we dwell
