W:In the bleak midwinter frosty wind made moan,
W:Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
W:Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
W:In the bleak midwinter, long a go.
W:
W:Angels and Archangels may have traveled there
W:Cherubim and Seraphim thronged the air
W:But only his Mother in her maiden bliss
W:Worshiped the beloved with a kiss
W:
W:What can I give him? Poor as I am
W:If I were a shepherd I would give a lamb
W:If I were a wise man I would do my part
W:But what I can I give him, give him my heart
