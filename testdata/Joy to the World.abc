w: Joy to the world! The Lord is come. Let earth re- ceive her King; Let e-_ very_ heart__ pre- pare_ Him_ room;__ And heav’n and na- ture_ sing, And_ heav’n and na- ture_ sing. And_ heav’n_ and heav’n__ and na- ture sing.
W:Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!
W:Let men their songs employ;
W:While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
W:Repeat the sounding joy,
W:Repeat the sounding joy,
W:Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.
W:
W:No more let sins and sorrows grow,
W:Nor thorns infest the ground;
W:He comes to make His blessings flow
W:Far as the curse is found,
W:Far as the curse is found,
W:Far as, far as, the curse is found.
W:
W:He rules the world with truth and grace,
W:And makes the nations prove
W:The glories of His righteousness,
W:And wonders of His love,
W:And wonders of His love,
W:And wonders, wonders, of His love.
