W:The First Noel the angel did say
W:Was to certain poor shepherds
W:in fields as they lay;
W:In fields as they lay, keeping their sheep,
W:On a cold winter's night that was so deep.
W:
W:Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
W:Born is the King of Israel.
W:
W:They looked up and saw a star
W:Shining in the east beyond them far,
W:And to the earth it gave great light,
W:And so it continued both day and night.
W:
W:And by the light of that same star
W:Three wise men came from country far;
W:To seek for a king was their intent,
W:And to follow the star wherever it went.
W:
W:This star drew nigh to the northwest,
W:O'er Bethlehem it took it rest,
W:And there it did both stop and stay
W:Right over the place where Jesus lay.
W:
W:Then entered in those wise men three
W:Full reverently upon their knee,
W:and offered there in his presence
W:Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
W:
W:Then let us all with one accord
W:Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;
W:That hath made heaven and earth of naught,
W:And with his blood mankind hath bought

W:While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
W:all seated on the ground,
W:the angel of the Lord came down
W:and glory shone around.
W:
W:'Fear not,' said he - for mighty dread
W:had seized their troubled mind -
W:'Glad tidings of great joy I bring
W:to you and all mankind:
W:
W:'To you in David's town this day
W:is born of David's line
W:a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.
W:And this shall be the sign:
W:
W:'The heavenly babe you there shall find
W:to human view displayed,
W:all meanly wrapped in swathing bands
W:and in a manger laid.'
W:
W:Thus spoke the seraph, and forthwith
W:appeared a shining throng
W:of angels praising God, who thus
W:addressed their joyful song:
W:
W:'All glory be to God on high,
W:and to the earth be peace;
W:goodwill henceforth from highest heaven
W:begin and never cease!'
