W:2.Angels from the realms of glory,
W:Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
W:Ye who sang creation's story,
W:Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
W:Come and worship,
W:Come and worship,
W:Worship Christ, the newborn King!
W:
W:3.Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
W:Watching o'er your flocks by night,
W:God with man is now residing,
W:Yonder shines the infant Light;
W:Come and worship,
W:Come and worship,
W:Worship Christ, the newborn King!
W:
W:4.Sages, leave your contemplations,
W:Brighter visions beam afar;
W:Seek the great desire of nations,
W:Ye have seen His natal star;
W:Come and worship,
W:Come and worship,
W:Worship Christ, the newborn King!
W:
W:5.Saints before the altar bending,
W:Watching long in hope and fear,
W:Suddenly the Lord, descending,
W:In His temple shall appear:
W:Come and worship,
W:Come and worship,
W:Worship Christ, the newborn King!

W:
W:1.As with gladness, men of old
W:Did the guiding star behold
W:As with joy they hailed its light
W:Leading onward, beaming bright
W:So, most glorious Lord, may we
W:Evermore be led to Thee.
W:
W:
W:2.As with joyful steps they sped
W:To that lowly manger bed
W:There to bend the knee before
W:Him Whom Heaven and earth adore;
W:So may we with willing feet
W:Ever seek Thy mercy seat.
W:
W:
W:3.As they offered gifts most rare
W:At that manger rude and bare;
W:So may we with holy joy,
W:Pure and free from sin’s alloy,
W:All our costliest treasures bring,
W:Christ, to Thee, our heavenly King.
W:
W:
W:4.Holy Jesus, every day
W:Keep us in the narrow way;
W:And, when earthly things are past,
W:Bring our ransomed souls at last
W:Where they need no star to guide,
W:Where no clouds Thy glory hide.
W:
W:
W:5.In the heavenly country bright,
W:Need they no created light;
W:Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
W:Thou its Sun which goes not down;
W:There forever may we sing
W:Alleluias to our King!
